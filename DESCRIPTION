Title: Gaussian mixture modeling for heavy-tailed distributions in Flow Cytometry data
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Matei Ionita
Maintainer: Matei Ionita <matei.ionita@gmail.com>
Description: Tailor provides a Gaussian mixture modeling workflow for working with
    flow cytometry data. The first step is a preliminary binning of the data, which
    is used for both weighted subsampling and initialization of the main algorithm. This
    serves to address the two main deficiencies of standard mixture modeling approaches: 
    slow runtime and sensitivity to initialization. The main algorithm is a weighted version
    of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, through which Tailor models the data
    as a superposition of mixture components. Finally, some of these components are merged,
    if there are strong indications that they belong to the same biological population.
