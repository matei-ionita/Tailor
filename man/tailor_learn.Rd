\arguments{
\item{data}{A flowSet, flowFrame or a matrix containing events along the rows, markers along columns.}

\item{params}{A list of markers to use; must be subset of colnames(data).}

\item{mixture_components}{The number of mixture components to learn. Some of these
are eventually merged, so it's a good idea to choose a number slightly larger than
the number of clusters you expect to get.}

\item{min_bin_size}{Bins with fewer events than this threshold are considered outliers, and are
ignored during the weighted EM algorithm. These events can still be assigned to clusters during
the prediction phase.}

\item{max_bin_size}{Bins with more events than this threshold are split, to ensure that the
weighted EM algorithm closely approximates a run of vanilla EM on the entire dataset.}

\item{mixtures_1D}{Pre-computed 1D mixture models, to be used for binning.
These are computed from scratch if not provided.}

\item{do_tsne}{Boolean flag; if true, computes t-SNE reduction to 2D of the bin centers,
for use in visualizations.}

\item{do_variance_correction}{Boolean flag; if true, corrects the variances of the mixture
components found in weighted EM, to account for intra-bin variance. TRUE is strongly recommended.}

\item{parallel}{Boolean flag; if true, uses multithreading to speed up computation.}

\item{verbose}{If > 0, outputs milestone information. If >=1, also outputs information about
running utilities. If >1, debugging mode.}
}
\value{
A tailor object containing:
\describe{
\item{fit}{The tailor model, a named list containing the mixture proportions, means and variances
of all mixture components.}
\item{mixtures_1D}{}
\item{cat_clusters}{A named list containing information about the categorical clusters found by
the model: phenotype, cluster centers, and a mapping from mixture components to categorical clusters.}
\item{tsne_centers}{Optional: a dimensional reduction to 2D of the bin centers.}
}
}
\description{
This function learns a tailor model from input data. It
computes a preliminary binning of the data, then computes a mixture model using
a weighted version of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm,
and finally merges mixture components which are positive/negative for the same
markers, using adaptive thresholds.
